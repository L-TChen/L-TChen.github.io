### Research

My research interests include, but are not limited to, 

  * automata theory
  * modal logic
  * category theory
  * foundations and applications of dependently typed programming

I generally find the categorical perspective of [theory B](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/1523/51895) interesting to me.
