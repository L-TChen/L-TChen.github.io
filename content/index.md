### About me

I am an assistant research fellow in the [Theory Research Group](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/page/ResearchOverview/Groups/Theory.html) at the Institute of Information Science, [Academia Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica) in Taiwan.

##### Research Interests

I am generally interested in mathematical structures in computer science, specifically, the so-called ['theory B'](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/1523/51895) of theoretical computer science.
My work so far spans dependently typed programming, programming languages, logic, and automata theory, employing logical and categorical methods.

Recently, I have been exploring the computational and logical aspects of type theory, particularly through the lens of the lens of [Curry-Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry–Howard_correspondence) correspondence.
I have worked on both the theory and practice of programming languages using [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/), a proof assistant and a dependently typed language.
This approach allows me to produce reliable, reproducible, and sometimes useful results.

### Prospective postdocs / assistants

I have some funding available to hire a self-motivated postdoc and research assistants to join me at Academia Sinica.\
If you find my work interesting to you, please feel free to send me an email with your résumé to initiate the conversation.
