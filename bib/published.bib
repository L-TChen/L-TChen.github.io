abstract = {The Sch{\"{u}}tzenberger product of monoids is a key tool for the algebraic treatment of language concatenation. In this paper we gener-alize the Sch{\"{u}}tzenberger product to the level of monoids in an algebraic category D, leading to a uniform view of the corresponding construc-tions for monoids (Sch{\"{u}}tzenberger), ordered monoids (Pin), idempotent semirings (Kl{\'{i}}ma and Pol{\'{a}}k), and algebras over a field (Reutenauer). In addition, assuming that D is part of a Stone-type duality, we derive a characterization of the languages recognized by Sch{\"{u}}tzenberger products.},

abstract = {Profinite equations are an indispensable tool for the algebraic classification of formal languages. Reiterman's theorem states that they precisely specify pseudovarieties, i.e. classes of finite algebras closed under finite products, subalgebras and quotients. In this paper Reiterman's theorem is generalised to finite Eilenberg-Moore algebras for a monad T on a variety D of (ordered) algebras: a class of finite T-algebras is a pseudovariety iff it is presentable by profinite (in-)equations. As an application, quasivarieties of finite algebras are shown to be presentable by profinite implications. Other examples include finite ordered algebras, finite categories, finite infinity-monoids, etc.},
